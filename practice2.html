    <h2 style="color: yellow;">Quotes from the show:</h2>
    <p style="color: red;">Im gonna add some of my favorite quotes</p>
    <p style="color: aqua;"><q>if you have time to think of a beautiful end then live beautifully until the end</q></p>
    <p style="color: aqua;"><q>There's this one organ that's even more important than my heart. You can't see it, but it's there. Because of it, I can stand tall, even if I'm all worn down, I can still walk. And if I don't go, it'll break. My soul will break. Even if my heart stops beating, it is still more important. It doesn't matter if I'm old and can't walk. It will still stand tall.</q></p>
    <p style="color: aqua;"><q>Tears are handy for washing away troubling and sad feelings. But when you grow up, you’ll learn that there are things so sad, they can never be washed away by tears. That there are painful memories that should never be washed away. So people who are truly strong laugh when they want to cry. They endure all of the pain and sorrow while laughing with everybody else.</q></p>
    <p style="color: aqua;"><q>When your friend is crying, cry with him. When your friend is worried, you should worry with him. And when your friend has an awkward bowel movement, then you must have an awkward bowel movement too. Shin-chan, if you are a friend, you should be able to share the other's pain, no matter what. And Shin-chan, if your friend goes down the wrong path… then you must stop your friend, even if it ruins your friendship. That is true samurai friendship.</q></p>
    <p style="color: aqua;"><q>Everyone's carrying something that matters. You just don't realize when you're carrying it. It's only after it slips out of your hand that you realize how heavy it was in the first place. So many times I thought that I'd never carry a load like that ever again. And yet, before I realized it, I was carrying it again. I'd feel so much better if I just got rid of it. But I just can't bring myself to do it</q></p>
